# Maximum Product of Subarray

## Approach

The problem of finding the maximum product of a subarray within an array can be efficiently solved using a dynamic programming approach. This involves tracking the maximum and minimum product of subarrays ending at each index, along with the overall maximum product found so far.

## Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize two variables, `max_prod` and `min_prod`, to track the maximum and minimum product of subarrays ending at the current index, respectively.
   - Initialize a variable `max_so_far` to keep track of the maximum product found so far.

2. **Iterative Process:**
   - Iterate through each element of the array.
   - Update `max_prod` and `min_prod` by considering three cases: multiplying the current element with `max_prod`, `min_prod`, or the current element itself.
   - Update `max_so_far` with the maximum of `max_so_far` and `max_prod`.

3. **Result:**
   - Return `max_so_far` as the final result, which represents the maximum product of a subarray within the array.

## Implementation Details

The implementation is done in C++ and consists of a single main function. Here are the key points:

- Read the size of the array `n`.
- Read the elements of the array `nums`.
- Initialize `max_prod`, `min_prod`, and `max_so_far`.
- Iterate through the array to update `max_prod`, `min_prod`, and `max_so_far`.
- Output the value of `max_so_far`.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm iterates through the array once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the array.
- **Space Complexity:** The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is O(1).

This dynamic programming approach efficiently computes the maximum product of a subarray within an array.
