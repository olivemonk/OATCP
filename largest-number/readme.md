# Largest Number

## Approach

The problem of finding the largest number that can be formed by concatenating a given array of integers can be efficiently solved using a custom comparison function and sorting.

## Steps

1. **Define Comparison Function:**
   - Define a custom comparison function `compare` that takes two integers and returns true if their concatenation results in a larger number when the first integer is placed before the second integer, otherwise false.

2. **Sort Array:**
   - Sort the array of integers using the custom comparison function. This ensures that the integers are arranged in a way that forms the largest number when concatenated.

3. **Concatenate Integers:**
   - Concatenate the sorted integers to form the result string.

4. **Check Leading Zero:**
   - Check if the first character of the result string is '0':
     - If it is '0', return "0" (since the largest number cannot start with '0').
     - Otherwise, return the result string.

## Implementation Details

The implementation can be done in any programming language that supports custom comparison functions, such as C++, Python, or Java. Here are the key points:

- Define the custom comparison function `compare`.
- Read the array of integers.
- Sort the array of integers using the custom comparison function.
- Concatenate the sorted integers to form the result string.
- Check if the first character of the result string is '0' and return "0" if true; otherwise, return the result string.

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** 
  - Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, where n is the size of the array.
  - Concatenating the integers takes O(n) time.
  - Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, so it's O(n log n).
- **Space Complexity:** 
  - Sorting usually requires O(n) extra space.
  - Concatenating the integers and storing the result string requires O(n) extra space.
  - Overall, the space complexity is O(n).

This algorithm efficiently finds the largest number that can be formed by concatenating a given array of integers, ensuring that the resulting number is as large as possible.
